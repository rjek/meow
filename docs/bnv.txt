BNV instruction extension space
-------------------------------

BNV, or Branch Never, is a useless instruction in that the CPU will never
execute it, and programmers should never use it (there are plenty of other
instructions that can act as a NOP should they want one.)

Because of this, it is specified that the BNV range (signed 9 bit integer, so
the range -256 to 255) will be given special purposes for custom behavior.

The range -256 to -1 is for the implementor of the CPU (be it msim or a hardware
implemention).  Some of these have defined meanings, listed below.
Implementation-specific BNV functions should be given positive numbers.

#-512		Sets IM(R12) to be the processor's model number.
		The high byte indicates implementor:
		
			0x00	-	MEOW official
			Other values are currently undefined
			
		The 2nd byte indicates model.  For MEOW offical, these are:
			
			0x00	-	MSIM
			0x01	-	Intial VHDL implementation
			
		The 3rd byte indicates revision.
		
		The 4th byte is implementation-defined, and current official
		MEOW implementations this is always zero.

#-510		HALT.  Causes the CPU to stop.  Under msim, it causes exit() to
		be called.
